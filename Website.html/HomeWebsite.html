      <p>The results shown for this ranking are based on reseach and 2024 - 2025 articles about the sportbikes.</p>
      <h2>What you need to know?</h2>
      <p>Sportbikes are also known as supersport motorcyles that are two-wheeled vehicles that are powered by engine, known for their speed and build 
        for high speed performances over comfort and safety. The main feature of the sportbikes are the high performance suspension system, powerful 
        powerful brakes and especially their fast acceleration. A sports motorcycle, sports bike, or sport bike is a motorcycle designed and optimized 
        for speed,  acceleration, braking, and cornering on asphalt concrete race tracks and roads. They are mainly designed for performance at the
        expense of comfort, fuel economy, safety, noise reduction and storage in comparison with other motorcycles.</p>
      <p> Sport bikes can be and are typically equipped with fairings and a windscreen to deflect wind from the rider to improve aerodynamics.</p>

                    with a recorded 155 horsepower at the wheel that could easily be increased to 160 horsepower with a full system. 
                    Knowing what superpower could be activated with a simple twist of our right wrist was an incredible experience, 
                    even if we didn't use it all in our daily riding. And everyone else recognized it, too, thanks to its unique melted 
                    wind-tunnel design. And that felt wonderful, guy. It was boss; both male and female Busa owners were an inch taller

    <h1>Maleficent Mistress Evil's Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>Once upon a time... or perhaps you remember this story about a Fey
        named <b>Maleficent.</b></p>
    <p>She had powers like none other in this world with big, black and
        powerful wings that can bring her up higher than the clouds,
        <br> so powerful and strong it can crush a man's skull within seconds.</p>

    <p>Her beautiful green eyes, pale skin and long black horns curved
        outwards with a pointy end was her signiture look.
        <br>A staff that contained a power beyond this world held in her right hand,
        <br> with her cape draped over her shoulders to hiding the scars from the betrayal of her first love.
        <br>A pet raven, or rather a sidekick named Diaval that can turn itself into a human 
        <br>with Maleficent's command and a flick of her hand, always around her or resting on her shoulder. 
        <br>The silhouette of Maleficent was feared by   men who dared to step  foot into her kingdom.
        <br>A flicker of her hands can destroy much in seconds. She was hunted by men and knights outside her kingdom, <b>The Moors.</b>

    <h2 style="font-style: bold;text-align: center;">Maleficent Mistress of Evil</h2>
    
<p>Once upon a time, there was two kingdoms that were the worst of neighbors.
    <br>Where one kingdom lived a greedy king who wanted to rule over them, and the other kingdom called <b>Moors,</b>
    <br>where different strange creatures lived and was ruled and protected by a powerful fairy called <b>Maleficent.</b>
    <br>Maleficent was relaxing under a tree, curing broken branches using her fairy powers to cure nature when one of the Spriggans,
    <br> also known as tree warriors, came to her in an alerting manner that they have encountered a young thief who stole a jewel in her kingdom. 
    <br>She quickly fled to the scene and met Stefan, where their love story started. Stefan visiting Maleficent as they explore the moors together.
    <br>Soon, Maleficent fell in love for the first time at her young age, sixteen. 
 </p>

<p> They grew up together in secret, Maleficent being hunted by Stefan's kind, the humans.
    <br>The king's last wish who fell sick after the war of attempting to take over the moors was to collect Maleficent's head, declaring that
    <br>whoever would serve him the head of the fairy would be the new heir of the kingdom. Stefan hearing all of this and wished to have that power came
    <br>with a plan. Knowing he could fool Maleficent into submission, he met up with her and bonded with her like the old times and gave her a drink mixed
    <br>with something else. Maleficent then fell unconscious in Stefan's arms. Stefan's plan was to serve the king Maleficent's head but the love he felt 
    <br>for her was more than his desire to have power. He decided to cut her precious, big and powerful wings and left her unconscious. 
    <br>He presented Maleficent's wings to the king and soon, he was crowned as the new king and had a daughter named Aurora. Maleficent was <b>livid.</b>    
</p>

 <p>Maleficent arrived to Aurora's intrduction to the public unannouced. Taking her revenge, anger and the 
    <br>deep betrayal she felt onto Stefan's daughter, Aurora. Cursing her, <b>"Before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger
    <br>on the spindle of the spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death, a sleep from which she will never awaken."</b> Stefan fell to his knees and begged
    <br>for Maleficent's forgiveness. <b>"Alright, She can be woken from her death sleep. But only by... a true love's kiss."</b> She growled and laughed then left 
    <br>the new born cursed for the rest of her life. The new born grew up with beautiful blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin and a very loving voice with a very caring nature.
</p>

<p>Aurora, the cursed princess lived away from the castle with three fairies that took care of her for 15 years,
    <br> Aurora then stumbled on the borders of moors, seeing Maleficent's silhouette with nothing else in her eyes but fascination, Aurora's gentleness softened 
    <br>Malificent and soon, they bonded. Aurora then found out that she was cursed, asking Maleficent if she knew anything about her curse that she didn't know Maleficent
    <br> was the one who cursed her. When Aurora found out Maleficent cursed her, she distanced herself as she felt hurt and betrayed by a fairy that she considered 
    <br>her fairy-god-mother that looked after her for most of her living years. Maleficent regreted giving Aurora the curse, despite her anger towards Aurora's father, 
    <br>King Stefan, she knew Aurora never deserved the curse. The sunset that was supposed to be Aurora's night of curse, Maleficent went to her, attempting to save her 
    <br>from the curse she placed in Aurora. 
</p>

<p> She arrived at Aurora's castle too late, she was already laying in bed, sleeping <b> like death</b> with no true love to 
    <br>to break the curse. Maleficent's love for the child was over powering her anger towards King Stefan. <b>I will not ask your forgiveness because what I have done to you 
    <br>is unforgivable... I was so lost in hatred and revenge. Sweet Aurora, you stole what was left of my heart. And now I have lost you forever."</b> 
</p>

<p>Maleficent then kissed Aurora's forehead, full of love and sympathy that broke her curse. 
    <br>Aurora awoke and forgave Maleficent and soon, Aurora helped Maleficent get her wings back that  King Stefan had cut and kept in the 
    <br>castle's basement. Maleficent gained her precious wings back and declared Aurora to be the first Human to rule over her kingdom, the Moors.

<blockquote cite="https://www.scripts.com/script/maleficent_13216" style="color: white;">A beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent has an idyllic life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day when an invading army threatens the harmony 
    <br>of the land. Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayalan act that begins to turn her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's successor and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that
    <br>Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom - and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.</blockquote>
